# git-lfs@2.xx

Some BitBucket instances don't support [Git LFS 3.0+ clients](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-12989),
but HomeBrew doesn't contain formula for older `git-lfs` versions.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install insanehunter/git-lfs-2/<formula>`

Or `brew tap insanehunter/git-lfs-2` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
